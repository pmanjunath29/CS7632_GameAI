The agent must destroy the enemy bases to win the game. Here is an example of a 5x5 map:\n","\n","```\n","[] T3 [] B1 [] \n","[] [] T2 [] [] \n","A  [] [] [] [] \n","[] T1 [] T0 [] \n","[] [] T4 [] B0\n","```\n","The agent is specified by `A`. There are two bases, `B0` and `B1`. There are five towers: `T0` through `T4`.\n","\n","Towers are and bases are automatically destroyed when the agent encounters them and they are no longer invincible. But when the agent encounters invincible towers and bases, the agent is automatically killed. This game emulates the high-level strategic planning, wherein an encounter between the agent and a tower or base might represent a drawn-out firefight.\n","\n","However, the towers must be destroyed in a specific order. The bases are ``guarded`` by towers. This means bases are invulnerable until the guarding towers are destroyed. Some towers may also be ``guarded`` by other towers and thus be invulnerable until the guarding towers are destroyed. \n","\n","For example, in the above map it might be the case that:\n","```\n","B0: guarded by T0\n","B1: guarded by T1\n","T0: guarded by T3 and T4\n","T1: guarded by T2\n","```\n","The game can be won by destroying towers in the following order: T2, T1, B1, T3, T4, T0, B0.\n","There are many possible orderings and the agent must discover one of the correct orderings.\n","\n","The guard configuration is represented internally in the game engine with a dictionary that you will be able to see but the agent will not be able to see:\n","```\n","{'B0': ['T0'], 'B1': ['T1'], 'T1': ['T2'], 'T0': ['T3', 'T4']}\n","```\n","The agent must learn one of the correct orderings through trial and error using either a **Minimax**-like algorithm or through **Monte Carlo Tree Search**.\n","\n","To facilitate this, we provide a means of scoring the agent's attempts. The agent gets -100 points for dying, either from encountering a tower or base that is still guarded, or by going off the edge of the map. \n","The agent gets +10 points for each tower destroyed.\n","The agent gets +50 points for each based destroyed.\n","The game ends when the agent is killed or when all bases are destroyed.\n","\n","The project comes is a set number of hand-crafted maps, but is also capable of generating new maps of arbitrary complexity.\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"rqKqbPfuooKs"},"source":["# Install and import"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":195,"metadata":{"id":"JKXVg9hp9rJR"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Requirement already satisfied: graphviz in c:\\users\\prana\\anaconda3\\envs\\ai_env\\lib\\site-packages (0.19.1)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pydot in c:\\users\\prana\\anaconda3\\envs\\ai_env\\lib\\site-packages (1.4.2)\n","Requirement already satisfied: pyparsing>=2.1.4 in c:\\users\\prana\\anaconda3\\envs\\ai_env\\lib\\site-packages (from pydot) (3.0.9)\n"]}],"source":["!pip install graphviz\n","!pip install pydot"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":196,"metadata":{"id":"hLflZkH7Dfbt"},"outputs":[],"source":["from typing import NamedTuple\n","from copy import copy, deepcopy\n","from enum import Enum\n","from functools import partial\n","import random\n","import math\n","import graphviz\n","import pydot\n","from IPython.display import Image"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"zVpabiH6iREs"},"source":["# Data Structures"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":197,"metadata":{"id":"9NM7xd8hDKbP"},"outputs":[],"source":["### Entity class: can be agents, towers, or bases\n","class Entity():\n","  def __init__(self, name, x, y, status):\n","    self.name = name          # Name\n","    self.x = x                # x position\n","    self.y = y                # y position\n","    self.status = status      # status from Status ENUM\n","\n","### State object\n","class State():\n","  def __init__(self, agent, towers = [], bases = [], terminal = False, rows=3, cols=3, guards = {}):\n","    self.agent = agent            # pointer to an agent Entity\n","    self.towers = towers          # list of tower Entity objects\n","    self.bases = bases            # list of base Entity objects\n","    self.terminal = terminal      # Is the state terminal (boolean)\n","    self.rows = rows              # Number of rows in grid\n","    self.cols = cols              # number of columns in grid\n","    self.guards = guards          # A dictionary of entity names (string) where \n","                                  # values are lists of entity names\n","                                  # E.g. {B0: [T1, T2]} means base B0 is guarded by towers T1 and T2\n","                                  # and B0 will only be vulnerable when T1 and T2 are Status.DEAD."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"LqFZlceaiPe4"},"source":["#Agent Actions"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"slTCLHR50VQN"},"source":["These functions describe the actions the agent can perform."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":198,"metadata":{"id":"meFBu07NEecS"},"outputs":[],"source":["def agent_east(state):\n","  state.agent.x = state.agent.x + 1\n","  return state\n","\n","def agent_north(state):\n","  state.agent.y = state.agent.y -
